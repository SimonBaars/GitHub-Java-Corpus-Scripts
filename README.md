# GitHub-Java-Corpus-Scripts
These scripts download a set of Java projects from GitHub and download all their dependencies. To use these scripts, place the file [valid_projects.txt](https://github.com/SimonBaars/GitHub-Java-Corpus-Scripts/blob/master/filtered_projects.txt) at the following location: `%home_folder%/clone/valid_projects.txt`. Then, run [CollectDependencies.java](https://github.com/SimonBaars/GitHub-Java-Corpus-Scripts/blob/master/src/main/java/com/simonbaars/githubjavacorpus/CollectDependencies.java). It will download all the github projects and their dependencies.

These scripts can be used if you require a set of software projects for research purposes.
